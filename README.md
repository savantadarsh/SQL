# CloudFlow Revenue and Retention Optimization Project 
## Business Objective
CloudFlow aims to **maximize recurring revenue and customer retention** by identifying key factors influencing subscription growth and churn. The objective of this project is to leverage data-driven insights to **optimize revenue streams** (through better product uptake and upsells) and **improve customer retention** (by addressing churn causes and engagement gaps). This will guide strategic initiatives to increase customer lifetime value and reduce churn rate.

## Company Background
CloudFlow is a **subscription-based SaaS company** offering cloud solutions on a tiered plan model (e.g. Basic, Pro, Premium). As a B2B-focused platform, CloudFlow serves organizations of varying sizes – from small teams to enterprise clients – on monthly or annual subscriptions. The company’s revenue model relies on **recurring subscription fees** and expansion within accounts (upselling additional product modules or higher-tier plans). Maintaining high customer satisfaction and continual product value is critical in **driving renewals and upgrades** in this SaaS model.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of the Revenue and Retention Optimization project is to **analyze CloudFlow’s usage, financial, and customer interaction data** to uncover actionable insights. By examining subscription revenues, user engagement patterns, support interactions, and conversion funnels, the project addresses key business questions:

*Where are we gaining or losing revenue?*

*Why do customers churn, and how can we prevent it?*

*Where do users encounter friction in the product or sales funnel?*

The analysis of these data points will help CloudFlow develop targeted strategies across product, marketing, engineering, and customer success teams to **boost revenue growth and improve retention.**

The dataset can be found [here](assets/BP1/tc.zip).

## Core Analysis and Scope
The analysis is organized into four thematic areas, each corresponding to a set of insights drawn from the data. For each theme, we outline the focus, key questions addressed, and relevant metrics (with findings) from the data.

## Revenue Trends and Product Performance
**Focus:** Evaluate how different products (subscription tiers) contribute to revenue and assess revenue trends over time.
**Key Questions:**
How does revenue break down by subscription tier (Basic, Pro, Premium), and which tier drives the most revenue?

What are the trends in monthly revenue over 2022–2023? (Are there seasonal spikes or declines, and how does year-over-year growth look?)

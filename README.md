# Calculating descriptive statistics for monthly revenue by product
## Business Problems:
1)	How much revenue does each product usually generate each month?
2)	Which product has the most success throughout all of last year?
3)	Did either product fluctuate greatly each month or was the month-to-month trend consistent?

For making quick insights, descriptive statistics are calculated. The minimum, maximum, average and standard deviation of monthly revenue for each product for the year 2022 are calculated. 
A common table expression (CTE) is used to achieve the business objectives.
